# Text Search Technique

### Description
Terminal based search engine for finding words contained text files. Written in Python 3.0.


### The setup


Open Text_search.py in an IDE. Then, on line 4, modify the path to your local directory containing the textfiles to scan.
```
directory = '/path/to/your/directory/word-searcher/textfiles'
```

Make sure to run the script from the parent directory to the folder containing the textfiles.
In above example this will be:
```
/path/to/your/directory/word-searcher/
```
Run script by typing "python3 Text_search.py"
